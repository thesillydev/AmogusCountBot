# AmogusCountBot

## Welcome, fellow reader!

If you are curious about AmogusCountBot and how to use it properly, just follow these tips and you'll get it pretty quickly.

### How to check the Amogus Counter of an user?

Just use `u/AmogusCountBot [user you wanna reply]`.

You can also just use `u/AmogusCountBot` to check to your own Amogus Counter.

### How to get replied by a copypasta:

The bot has few words that you can trigger him to send a copypasta such as `amongus` and `you're sus`. <br/>
Fortunately(Or unfortunately, depending of the case), you can check all the words that triggers him on the `sussy_keywords` parameter of the bot code.

## Some cool questions that's worthy being added(I guess):

### Which subreddits the bot replies the amogus counter?

Literally everywhere, except where the bot was banned. 

### Which subreddits the bot replies the copypastas?

In many subreddits, such as `amogus`, `fridaynightfunkin`, `comedynecrophilia` and so goes on. <br/>
To get the full list, you can access the code and check the `subreddits` parameter.

### Can I use your code to create new bots similar to yours?

Sure! This bot has MIT license and it's just a personal project. <br/>
The only thing shouldn't try is to copy my bot and fake it as the original. <br/>
That's a really suspicious behavior.

### How can I help the bot?

Just by using it and suggesting new things to add on my bot helps it so much, mainly if it's related to the bot code. <br/>
But if you want support me financially(I don't know why), you can buy me a [Geometry Dash game.](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/yandevpy)
